          <p>
            There’s more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than
            focusing on block style information architecture, you can create
            refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful
            photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to
            scroll further down the page.

          <p>
            Do you want to tell a story with your product or service?
            Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and
            encourages meaningful interaction from users.

          <h2>Simple Interface<br> for Smart device Users</h2>
          <p>
            Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It’s
            now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping.
            Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
            providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users

          <p>
            Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor
            website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their
            message and vision into one dynamic web design page.

          <h2>Easier for users to<br> relive their goal</h2>
          <p>
            These days, scrolling is so simple that it’s become an
            instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page
            requires thought and motivation. A single page website
            allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker,
            than needing to sift through multiple pages.

            search engine savvy</p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that
            they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of
            pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and
            negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results
            page (SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.

          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Slower Load Times</h2>
          <p>
            50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn’t loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the
            more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to
            load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax
            websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to
            load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites
            loaded within a few seconds.

          <h2 style="text-align: right;">Awkward navigation</h2>
          <p style="text-align: right;">
            Instead of hitting the “back” button, users must scroll back
            up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to
            refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is
            to include top navigation and have each element anchored
            to a category or section.
